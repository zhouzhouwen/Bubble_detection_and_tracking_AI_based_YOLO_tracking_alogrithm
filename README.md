Abstract
Critical Heat Flux (CHF) plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliability and safety within two-phase flow boiling systems. Despite the development of numerous CHF prediction tools using conventional empirical correlations, machine learning, and deep learning methods, the complex mechanisms underlying CHF continue to challenge the creation of a unified, accurate, and robust prediction model. The complexity is further exacerbated by varying experimental conditions and data over decades of research. In response to these challenges, this work leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) method, including artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), Transformer model, and transfer learning techniques. The proposed AI-based CHF prediction model, particularly the Transformer model employing self-attention mechanisms, dynamically assigns importance to different parts of the input data, significantly improving the model's capability for CHF prediction. The results indicate that the predictive performance of this Transformer-based AI model exceeds that of the Look-Up Table (LUT) method and a benchmark model from the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). Additionally, the AI-based CHF prediction model's physical behaviors are examined and compared with the LUT method. This comparison confirmed the model's resistance to overfitting. Finally, utilizing transfer learning, the model's ability to predict CHF in tubes is extended to annulus and plate geometries, showcasing the flexibility and robustness of AI-based CHF prediction model. AI-based methods not only sets a new standard in CHF prediction but also illustrates the potential of advanced deepiing learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of thermal hydraulic models in nuclear engineering.
